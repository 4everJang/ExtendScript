# ExtendScript
Tutorials for automating Adobe<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> FrameMaker<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> with ExtendScript.

##About ExtendScript

ExtendScript was developed by Adobe for the Creative Suite products.
In 2011, with the release of FrameMaker version 10, it also became available in the 
Technical Communication Suite.

ExtendScript is basically JavaScript with a large number of objects, properties
and methods for each Adobe product. Creating scripts is done in the ESTK 
(ExtendScript Toolkit), which is packaged with all Adobe products that
have the scripting support.

ExtendScript provides access to most of the functions of FrameMaker, 
allowing you to automate tasks in FrameMaker without requiring a programming environment
like Visual Studio to make it all work.

##About this repository

As the object model of FrameMaker is extensive and ExtendScript - being based
on JavaScript - can be unforgiving about typos and small scripting errors, 
it can be a daunting task to make your automation work.

A group of experienced scripters have joined forces to create this repository,
which contains an ever expanding series of tutorials as well as sample scripts for every
FrameMaker user to explore and put to their own use.
